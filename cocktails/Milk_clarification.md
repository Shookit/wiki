# Milk clarification

## Ingredients

- 1 part milk
- 2 part sour-type cocktail (whisky sour, jungle bird, etc.)


## Directions

- Mix all ingredients besides milk
- Do an initial strain of the mixture through a coffee filter
- Slowly add ingredients to milk, gently stir, and let sit for an hour
- Strain mixture thru a coffee filter, collect initial drippings in a separate bowl, and add them back to re-strain
    - It's the milk curds, not the filter medium that clarifies the mixture
    - Initial drippings won't have been filtered through an initial curds bed, so you must double strain the initial drippings
- Let mixture slowly strain overnight

## General

- Efficiency modules help a ton with pollution
- Always smelt right under ore patch
- For space logistics, use named logistic groups. These always "pull" resources. So you create a logistic group named `Vulcanus exports`. You pull into your space platform by setting it on your space platform, and pull into a cargo pod on e.g., Nauvis by setting it on your cargo landing pad. But you can reuse the same named logistic group in both of those "pull" spots.


## Expansion

- Expand to other mineral patches in only one direction. Resource patches get bigger as you get farther away from center, so this maximizes how big the resource patchces are.
- When expanding to planets, first order of business is to get regular space logistics between Nauvis working
- Keep two sides of the bus open to allow easier expansion


## Nauvis

### Starter bus

- Group 1
    - 4 iron
- Group 2
    - 4 copper
- Group 3
    - 2 green
    - 2 steel
- Group 4
    - 1 plastic
    - 1 red
    - 1 coal
    - 1 stone
- Group 5
    - 1 petrol
    - 1 lube
    - 1 light oil
    - 1 water


### Build order

- Rush
    - Construction bots (get early lube)
    - Nuclear power
    - Personal fission reactor and personal upgrades
- Swap brick with steel smelters early, but no electric until you have nuclear


### Notes

- Iron is more important early, copper becomes more important later. So start with 2 iron, 1 copper, 1 steel smelting.
- Belt logistics until you have advanced logistics chests
- Secure choke points and clear nests within so that you don't end up playing wack-a-mole
- Make an early basic science platform and just float it out there to get science
- Make a temporary minimal belt mall (what to include), then a robot mall
- Don't bother with anything besides yellow inserters/belts until your belt is saturated. Downgrade/upgrade books together to help with the above.


## Vulcanus

### Notes

- Don't need to bring anything for defense
- Solar is highly efficient
- Fluid has basically unlimited capacity, so bus molten iron/copper instead of lava


### Starter bus

- Need to do this fresh next time
- Ship around molten copper and iron wherever possible instead of doing a ton of plate smelting
- Try using logistic bots for calcite instead of belting it everywhere


### Exports

- Science
- Foundries
- Big miners
- Calcite


## Fulgora

### Notes

- Don't need to bring anything for defense


### Exports

- Science
- Electromagnetic plant


## Questions

- What should a minimal belt mall include?

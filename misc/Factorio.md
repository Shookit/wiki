# Factorio

## Build notes

- Iron is more important early, copper becomes more important later
- Make an early basic science platform


## Expansion

- Securing choke points and clear nests within so that you don't end up playing wack-a-mole
- Expand to other mineral patches in only one direction. Resource patches get bigger as you get farther away from center, so this maximizes how big the resource patchces are.


## Bus

- Temporary minimal belt mall (what to include), then a robot mall


### Questions

- What should a minimal belt mall include?


## Vulcanus

- Solar is highly efficient

### Questions

- Ship red/green/blue/white science for some of the initial research? Depends on how much 
- Can you ship a rocket silo or its constituent parts to the location? Otherwise just ship science over to drop.

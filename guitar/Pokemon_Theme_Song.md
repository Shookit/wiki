[Verse]

Am             G
I wanna be the very best

     Am         G
Like no one ever was

Dm                C
To catch them is my real test

   Am         F*    E
To train them is my cause

Am            G
I will travel across the land

Am                 G
Searching far and wide

Dm              C
Each Pokemon to understand

    Am    F*     E
The power that's inside


[Chorus]

    F
Pokemon!

     C
It's you and me

F               G
I know it's my destiny

    Am
Pokemon!

            G
Ooh, you're my best friend

     Am       F*   E
In a world we must defend

    Am
Pokemon!

    G
Our hearts so true

    Dm           G
Our courage will pull us through

F                C
You teach me and I'll teach you

Am  E
Pokemon

                F
Gotta catch 'em all!

                Am
Gotta catch 'em all!


[Verse]

Am              G
Every challenge along the way

     Am             G
With courage I will face

Dm             C
I will battle every day

   Am       F*       E
To claim my rightful place

Am                G
Come with me, the time is right

Am                G
There's no better team

Dm               C
Arm in arm we'll win the fight

     Am     F*       E
It's always been our dream


[Chorus]

    F
Pokemon!

     C
It's you and me

F               G
I know it's my destiny

    Am
Pokemon!

            G
Ooh, you're my best friend

     Am       F*   E
In a world we must defend

    Am
Pokemon!

    G
Our hearts so true

    Am           F*      E
Our courage will pull us through

F                C
You teach me and I'll teach you

Am  E
Pokemon

                F
Gotta catch 'em all!

      E         Am
Gotta catch 'em all!

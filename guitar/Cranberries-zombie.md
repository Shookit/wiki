Intro:
Em C G D x4

Em           C
Another head hangs lowly
        G         D
Child is slowly taken
Em                   C
And the violence caused such silence
    G            D
Who are we mistaken

             Em
but you see, it's not me
            C
it's not my family
         G
in your head, in your head
              D
they are fighting

            Em
With their tanks, and their bombs,
           C
and their bombs, and their guns
         G                            D
In your head, in your head they are crying

         Em            C
In your head, In your head
     G             D
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey
                Em            C
What's in your head in your head
 G               D
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, oh oh

Em C G D x2

Em        C
Another mother's breaking
 G                D
heart is taking over
Em                    C
when the violence causes silence
G                D
we must be mistaken

              Em                C
it's the same old theme since 19-16
         G                                D
in your head, in your head they're still fighting

            Em
With their tanks, and their bombs,
           C
and their bombs, and their guns
         G                             D
In your head, in your head they are crying

         Em            C
In your head, In your head
     G             D
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey
                Em            C
What's in your head in your head
 G               D                      Em
Zombie, zombie, zombie, hey, hey, hey, oh oh

                    C                           G   D
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh hey hey ya

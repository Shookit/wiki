[Intro] 

| D       | G       | Bm    A | G       | x2

 
[Verse 1]

D                              G
  When I was young, I knew everything

     Bm                    A    G
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice

        D                               G
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor

Bm                      A     G
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no
 

[Pre-Chorus]

Bm   A    G
          Can't be held responsible

Bm   A    G
          She was touching her face

Bm   A    G
        I won't be held responsible

Bm   A            G
      She fell in love in the first place


[Chorus]

D                    G
  For the life of me,  I cannot remember

Bm                        A       G
  What made us think that we were wise

                     D
And we'd never compromise?

                   G
For the life of me,  I cannot believe

     Bm                   A   G
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen


[Interlude]

| D       | G       | Bm    A | G


[Verse 2]

        D                      G
My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her

    Bm                 A        G
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept

             D                                G
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor

  Bm                      A     G
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm    A    G
          "Can't be held responsible

Bm    A    G
           She was touching her face

Bm    A    G
         I won't be held responsible

Bm    A            G
       She fell in love in the first place"


[Chorus]

D                    G
  For the life of me,  I cannot remember

Bm                        A       G
  What made us think that we were wise

                     D
And we'd never compromise?

                   G
For the life of me,  I cannot believe

     Bm                  A    G
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen


[Bridge]

F#m   G   D   A      F#m       G       D    A
                Hey yah eyah eyah eyaha

       F#m     G      D    A
Hey eyaaaaaaah

      F#m        G         D   A
Hey eyah eyah eyah eyahaaa


[Verse 3]

D                               G
  We tried to wash our hands of all of this

           Bm              A     G
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships

               D                              G
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor

   Bm                   A       G
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say


[Pre-Chorus]

Bm   A   G
        "Can't be held responsible

Bm   A   G
         She was touching her face

Bm   A       G
      And I won't be held responsible

Bm   A              G
      She fell in love in the first place"


[Chorus]

D                    G
  For the life of me,  I cannot remember

Bm                       A       G
 What made us think that we were wise

                     D
And we'd never compromise?

                   G
For the life of me,  I cannot believe

     Bm                  A    G
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

D                    G
  For the life of me,  I cannot remember

Bm                       A       G
 What made us think that we were wise

                     D
And we'd never compromise?

                   G
For the life of me,  I cannot believe

     Bm       A               G
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

D      G
      We were merely freshmen

Bm    A G
        We were only freshmen

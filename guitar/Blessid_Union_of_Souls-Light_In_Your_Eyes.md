# Blessid Union of Souls - Light in Your Eyes

Capo 4th Fret

```
G       C            D              C         G        C D C G
I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye

G        C                  D            C           G   C D C G
All our "I love you's" were just not enough to survive 

               Bm         C
Something your eyes never told me 

G                              D
But it's only now too plain to see 

          Bm                C
Brilliant disguise when you hold me 

        A      C D
And I'm free 

G         C            D                C               G   C D C G
I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude

G             C           D             C          G     C D C G
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use 

              Bm           C
But how could I have known girl 

G                                   D
It was time and not space you would need 

        Bm              C                      A
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know 

C             D
But would you believe 

 

Chorus:


G                                 C         D
There's a light in your eyes that I used to see 

G                                   C         D
There's a place in your heart where I used to be

G                                   C           A
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me

          G
There's a light in your eyes

        C                D           G
Did you leave that light burning for me

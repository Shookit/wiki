======================================

Capo on 4th

Intro: D


[Verse]

D
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

A
I was in your sights, you got me alone

Bm                              G
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e

D
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that

    A
And when I fell hard, you took a step back

    Bm                      G          D
Without me, without me, without meeeee


[Pre-chorus]

              A                       Bm
And he's long gone, when he's next to me and I

       G                   -stop
Realize the blame is on me


[Chorus]

(one strum)
       Bm             Em                       A
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

       D       A     Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                 A
Flew me to places I'd never been

          D     A
'Till you put me down, oh

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

       D        A      Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                  A
Flew me to places I'd never been

        D -mute                Bm
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!


[Post-chorus]

Bm  Em   A            D        A      Bm
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Bm  Em   A            D        A
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble


[Verse]

D
No apologies, he'll never see you cry

   A
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why

       Bm                                G
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing

      D
Now I heard you moved on, the whispers on the street

  A
A new notch in your belt, it's all I'll ever be

    Bm                    G                   D
And now I see, now I see, now I'll see-e-e-e-e


[Pre-chorus]

            A                 Bm
He was long gone, when he met me

            G                      G
And I realize, the joke is on me,  yeah


[Chorus]

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

       D        A      Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                  A
Flew me to places I'd never been

          D      A
'Till you put me down, oh

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

       D        A      Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                  A
Flew me to places I'd never been

        D            A         Bm
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!


[Post-chorus]

Bm  Em   A            D        A      Bm
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Bm  Em   A            D        A
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

        Em                Bm
And the saddest fear, comes creepin' in


[Bridge]

         Em
That you never loved me or her,

   A         G        A
Or anyone, or anything, yeah yeah


[Chorus]

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

       D        A      Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                  A
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)

          D      A
'Till you put me down, oh

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there)

       D        A      Bm
It's a shame on me now-ow

           Em                  A
Flew me to places I'd never been

        D            A         Bm
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!


[Post-chorus]

Bm  Em   A            D        A      Bm
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Bm  Em   A            D        A
Ahh   oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

         D        A
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Bm              Em                       A
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

         D        A
Trouble, trouble, trouble

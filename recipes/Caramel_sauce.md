## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons Bourbon, optional
- 1 tablespoon Pure Vanilla Extract
- 2 cups Granulated Sugar
- 12 tablespoons Salted Butter, sliced into tablespoons
- 1 cup Heavy Cream
- 1 teaspoon Sea Salt


## Directions

1. In small bowl, combine the bourbon and vanilla extract. Stir and set aside.
2. Add the granulated super to a medium sized saucepan (3 quart size works well). Place it over medium-high heat and cook, watching the entire time and stirring occasionally, until the sugar is golden brown and completely melted.
3. Carefully add the butter and the vanilla bourbon mixture. Whisk the ingredients vigourously until the butter is completely melted. The contents of the saucepan will bubble up, so caution should be used.
4. Remove the pan from the heat and very carefully and slowly pour in the heavy cream while whisking. The caramel sauce will bubble, but keep whisking until the mixture is completely incorporated. Stir in the sea salt.
5. Let cool â€” do not attempt to lick the spoon or the whisk as the caramel will be incredibly hot.
6. After it has cooled to room temperature, transfer to your prefered storage container and serve how you like!

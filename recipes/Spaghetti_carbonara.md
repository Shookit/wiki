Spaghetti carbonara
===================

Ingredients
-----------

- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 2 additional egg yolks, room temperature
- 1/3 packed cup grated pecorino Romano
- 1/3 packed cup grated Parmesan
- 3.5 ounces of slab guanciale, pancetta or bacon, sliced into pieces
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Coarsely ground black pepper
- 12 ounces spaghetti


Directions
----------

1. Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high heat, and bring to a boil.
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and cheeses. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.
3. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the pork, and saut√© until the fat just renders, on the edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the pork over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.
5. Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated cheese and pepper.

Split Pea and Ham Soup
======================

Ingredients
-----------

- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 2 large ribs celery, finely diced
- 6 ounces ham (whole, not diced)
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound dried green split peas
- 2 quarts low-sodium chicken stock
- 2 bay leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Directions
----------

1. In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and ham and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds.
2. Add peas, chicken stock, bay leaves, and baking soda. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, and cover, leaving lid slightly ajar. Cook until peas are tender, about 1 hour.
3. Remove ham and bay leaves. Pulse soup using an immersion blender, until very roughly pureed but still chunky. **Do not overblend** - overblending can make the soup gluey. Strain the soup through a medium strainer. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Dice ham and add to soup.

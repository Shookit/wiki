Gumbo
=====

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon canola or vegetable oil, divided
- 2 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- Kosher salt
- 1/2 pound Cajun-style andouille sausage, sliced crosswise 1/2 inch thick
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large yellow onions, diced
- 2 green bell peppers, diced
- 4 large celery ribs, diced
- 8 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 quarts low-sodium chicken stock
- 2 dried bay leaves
- 2 large sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 pound fresh okra, caps trimmed, pods cut crosswise 1/2 inch thick (optional, see below)
- 1/2 teaspoon filé powder, plus more as needed for serving (optional, see below)
- Warm rice, thinly sliced scallions, and hot sauce, for serving


Directions
----------

1. In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season chicken all over with salt. Working in batches, sear chicken until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter, then set aside until cool enough to handle. Once chicken has cooled, shred into bite-size pieces.
2. Add sliced andouille to pot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a platter and set aside.
3. Combine the flour and 1 cup oil and cook, uncovered, in a 350°F oven, stirring every 30 minutes, until roux is chestnut or chocolate-brown, about 4 hours. Timing vary dramatically depending on your oven.
4. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery to the roux and season lightly with salt. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring and scraping, until softened, about 10 minutes; lower heat to medium if any of the ingredients threaten to scorch.
5. Stir in garlic, cayenne, and a generous amount of black pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes longer.
6. Add stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a gentle simmer, then allow to cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Add okra, if using, along with sausage and shredded chicken, and gently simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour longer. Skim any fat from the surface as it accumulates.
7. Remove from heat and add filé powder, if using, stirring well to break up any small lumps. Season gumbo with salt. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.
8. Serve gumbo with warm rice, sprinkling sliced scallions on top of each bowl. Pass hot sauce at the table, as well as filé powder, if desired, to lightly shake on top of each serving of gumbo and rice.

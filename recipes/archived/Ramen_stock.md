## Ingredients

- 4 inches ginger, roughly sliced and unpeeled
- 1 head of garlic, sliced in half, unpeeled
- 1/2lb Dried mushrooms (shiitake is classic but any kinds works) 
- 3-5lb chicken bones
- 2lb pork spare ribs
- 2 bunches scallions
- 2 medium carrots, roughly chopped 
- 1 onion, chopped in half
- Kombu (this is a Japanese dried seaweed, NOT nori)
- Bonito flakes
- Bay leaves 

## Directions

0.	If using the kombu, bonito flakes, and dried mushrooms, combine with some hot water and cover. Let sit for a few hours, or preferably, overnight. Strain and save the liquid and mushrooms, discard kombu and bonito flakes. This infused liquid is called “Dashi.”
1.	Set your largest pot (I mean it!!! Helps you make extra) over medium high heat with some neutral flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc.). Add chicken bones and pork if using, and brown thoroughly, ensuring they don’t burn as it will give stock a bitter flavor. Once browned, remove from pot. 
2.	Add in all vegetables and aromatics (onion, garlic, ginger, carrots, mushrooms) and brown briefly in the pot. Add in a big pinch of salt, they should release their liquid. Make sure that once there’s liquid in the pot, you scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon- that’s pure flavor. 
3.	Add the rest of your ingredients into the pot, and cover with dashi, if using. If not, just cover it with water. Bring to a boil, and then lower heat so it’s simmering. 
4.	Simmer for at least 5 hours, though 8 hours will be even better. Skim off any foam or scum that rises to the top while simmering.
5.	Strain thoroughly using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Strain repeatedly if stock is not clear.
